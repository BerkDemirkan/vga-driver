2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_generator/inst/i_clk is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks o_pixel_clock_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks o_pixel_clock_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks o_pixel_clock_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks o_pixel_clock_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_generator/inst/i_clk is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_generator/inst/i_clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel MMCMs or PLLs  
The clocks o_pixel_clock_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
